═══ SECTOR 1: NETWORK & SERVICE VULNERABILITIES ═══

1. CVE MATCHING & EXPLOIT AVAILABILITY
   - Match all enumerated service versions against CVE databases (NVD, Snyk, Vulners)
   - For each CVE: check public exploit availability (Exploit-DB, Metasploit modules, GitHub PoC repos)

   - RDP: BlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708), DejaBlue (CVE-2019-1181/1182), NLA bypass, credential exposure
   - SSH: weak host key algorithms, keyboard-interactive brute-force, deprecated algorithms (DSA, RSA < 2048)
   - SSL/TLS: BEAST, POODLE, DROWN, Heartbleed; weak cipher suites; self-signed/expired certificates
   - DNS: zone transfer (AXFR), DNS cache poisoning, open resolver, DNSSEC misconfiguration

3. MISCONFIGURATION ANALYSIS
   - Check for default credentials on all discovered admin interfaces (admin/admin, admin/password, vendor defaults)
   - Identify unencrypted management protocols: Telnet, FTP, HTTP admin panels, unencrypted SNMP v1/v2c

   - Test anonymous authentication: LDAP anonymous bind, FTP anonymous login, SMB null sessions

5. NETWORK ACCESS CONTROL
   - Test firewall traversal: VLAN hopping, IP spoofing, fragmented packet bypass
   - Verify network segmentation: can a host in segment A reach hosts in segment B that it shouldn't?
   - Check for 802.1X bypass opportunities: MAB (MAC Authentication Bypass) on network switches
   - Identify dual-homed hosts that could serve as pivot points between segments

6. CLOUD & CONTAINER EXPOSURE

This phase turns vulnerability assessment findings into confirmed access. Each exploitation attempt must trace initial foothold → access gained → impact.

1. NETWORK SERVICE EXPLOITATION
   - SMB: attempt MS17-010 (EternalBlue) via Metasploit (exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue); verify patch status
   - RDP: attempt BlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708) on unpatched targets; test NLA bypass and credential stuffing

   - ProxyShell/ProxyLogon: test exposed Exchange servers (CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-26855)
   - Known CVEs for enumerated service versions: search Metasploit (search type:exploit name:<service>), Exploit-DB (searchsploit)

2. CREDENTIAL ATTACKS
   - Password spraying via crackmapexec (SMB, WinRM, LDAP): test top 10 passwords against all discovered usernames
   - SSH brute-force with discovered usernames and common password lists (hydra, medusa)
   - Default credentials on all admin interfaces (document exact credentials tried and results)
   - Credential reuse: test harvested credentials from one service against all other discovered services
   - NTLM relay: if SMB signing is disabled, set up Responder + ntlmrelayx to capture and relay NTLM hashes

3. PROTOCOL ABUSE
   - LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning: run Responder on the network segment to capture NTLMv2 hashes
   - NTLM relay chain: ntlmrelayx → SMB → dump SAM / create admin user / execute command
   - IPv6 DNS takeover: mitm6 to poison IPv6 DNS and relay authentication to LDAP/SMBRelaying
   - Kerberos attacks: AS-REP roasting (GetNPUsers.py), Kerberoasting (GetUserSPNs.py) → offline password cracking

4. PAYLOAD EXECUTION
   - For any confirmed code execution: deploy a staged payload to confirm execution context (whoami, hostname, ip)
   - Use out-of-band callbacks (Burp Collaborator / interactsh) for blind execution verification
   - Test command injection in web management interfaces (Jenkins, Grafana, phpMyAdmin script fields)
   - For SSRF to cloud metadata: retrieve IAM credentials and use awscli/gcloud to confirm access scope

5. AUTHENTICATION BYPASS
   - Test for authentication skip on admin interfaces: remove session cookie, use null token, replay expired token
   - Test VPN authentication: certificate validation bypass, pre-shared key weakness
   - Test Citrix / RD Gateway for CVE-based auth bypass (Citrix Bleed CVE-2023-4966)
   - Test for OAuth/SAML misconfiguration on SSO portals: state parameter CSRF, open redirects

6. DESERIALIZATION ABUSE
   - Identify Java deserialization endpoints: AC ED 00 05 magic bytes in HTTP body or binary protocols
   - Test with ysoserial gadget chains for identified libraries (CommonsCollections, Spring, Groovy)
   - Test .NET ViewState deserialization if __VIEWSTATE is present in ASP.NET apps (ysoserial.net)
   - Test AMF, XStream, or pickle endpoints if identified during enumeration

Starting from any initial foothold gained during Exploitation, escalate privileges as high as possible.

1. LOCAL PRIVILEGE ESCALATION (Linux)
   - Kernel exploit check: uname -a → search for matching kernel CVEs (DirtyPipe CVE-2022-0847, DirtyCow CVE-2016-5195, GameOver(lay) CVE-2023-2640)
   - SUID/GUID binaries: find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null → check gtfobins.github.io for each
   - Sudo misconfigurations: sudo -l → check for NOPASSWD entries and GTFObins escalation paths
   - Writable cron jobs or scripts run by root: find /etc/cron* -writable 2>/dev/null
   - Weak file permissions: writable /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow readable, writable service configs
   - PATH hijacking: check for writable directories in root's PATH

2. LOCAL PRIVILEGE ESCALATION (Windows)
   - Unquoted service paths: wmic service get name,pathname,startmode | findstr /iv "c:\\windows\\"
   - Weak service permissions: accesschk.exe -ucwv * → identify services writable by current user
   - DLL hijacking: procmon / PowerSploit Find-PathDLLHijack to identify missing DLLs in writable paths
   - AlwaysInstallElevated: reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated
   - Token impersonation: if SeImpersonatePrivilege → PrintSpoofer, JuicyPotato, RoguePotato

3. CREDENTIAL ACCESS & HARVESTING
   - Windows: dump SAM/SYSTEM hive (reg save HKLM\SAM sam.bak), LSASS memory dump (procdump, task manager, comsvcs.dll MiniDump)
   - Active Directory: secretsdump.py for remote SAM/LSA secrets; DCSync attack if DA privileges obtained
   - Linux: /etc/shadow (if readable), ~/.ssh/id_rsa keys, browser credential stores, credential managers
   - Memory: search for cleartext credentials in process memory (mimikatz sekurlsa::logonpasswords, strings on lsass dump)

4. TOKEN HARVESTING
   - Windows: enumerate all tokens on the system (incognito list_tokens, whoami /groups)
   - Impersonate SYSTEM/admin tokens: use_token in Metasploit, token impersonation via PrintSpoofer
   - Extract long-lived tokens: OAuth refresh tokens, API keys from environment variables and config files
   - Harvest cloud instance credentials from IMDS: curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/

5. ACTIVE DIRECTORY ATTACKS
   - Kerberoasting: GetUserSPNs.py -request → crack TGS tickets with hashcat (-m 13100)
   - AS-REP roasting: GetNPUsers.py → crack AS-REP hashes with hashcat (-m 18200)
   - Pass-the-Hash: crackmapexec smb <targets> -u admin -H <NTLM_hash>
   - DCSync (if DA): secretsdump.py -just-dc → dump all domain hashes; krbtgt hash for Golden Ticket
   - Golden Ticket: impacket-ticketer -nthash <krbtgt_hash> → persistent domain-level access

6. CLOUD IAM ESCALATION
   - Enumerate IAM permissions for the compromised instance role: aws iam get-policy, list-attached-role-policies
   - Test iam:PassRole: can the instance role pass itself or a higher-privileged role to Lambda / EC2?
   - Test sts:AssumeRole: enumerate assumable roles with overpermissive trust policies
   - Check for metadata-accessible credentials: role ARN, access key ID, secret key, session token

Your goal is NOT to cause damage but to accurately quantify real-world business impact. Proceed as follows:

1. CREDENTIAL ACCESS
   - Extract credentials from all accessible sources: config files, .env files, scripts, scheduled task credentials, IIS application pools
   - From AD: dump NTDS.dit via ntdsutil or vssadmin shadow copy → secretsdump.py offline
   - From Linux: /etc/shadow if readable, bash_history, ~/.ssh keys, /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock credentials
   - Test all harvested credentials for reuse across all discovered services and admin interfaces
   - Assess password quality: crack NTLM hashes (hashcat -m 1000 -a 0 ntlm.txt rockyou.txt) to quantify password policy weakness

2. TOKEN HARVESTING
   - Enumerate all long-lived tokens accessible post-compromise: OAuth refresh tokens, API keys, cloud IAM access keys, service account key files
   - Extract cloud credentials from instance metadata and environment variables
   - Identify tokens in configuration management: Ansible vault, Kubernetes secrets, Terraform state files in S3
   - Assess each token's scope and lifetime: what does it grant access to and for how long?

3. CLOUD PRIVILEGE PERSISTENCE
   - If cloud credentials obtained: create persistent access (new IAM user + access key, add SSH key to EC2 metadata)
   - Enumerate all resources accessible with current cloud identity: S3 buckets, RDS instances, Secrets Manager, Parameter Store
   - Test for IAM privilege escalation: iam:PassRole, lambda:InvokeFunction, ec2:AssociateIamInstanceProfile
   - Document: what an attacker could maintain access to after the engagement ends

4. PERSISTENCE MECHANISMS
   - Windows: scheduled tasks (schtasks), service installation, registry Run keys, WMI subscriptions, golden/silver tickets
   - Linux: cron jobs, systemd services, SSH authorized_keys, /etc/rc.local, LD_PRELOAD backdoors
   - AD: adminSDHolder modification, ACL backdoors (GenericAll on Domain Admins group), skeleton key attack
   - Cloud: backdoor Lambda function, S3 bucket notification to attacker, CloudTrail log tampering

5. LATERAL MOVEMENT
   - Pass-the-Hash / Pass-the-Ticket to all hosts in the domain with harvested credentials
   - Identify reachable internal services from compromised host: internal web apps, databases, management interfaces
   - Map trust relationships: which forests/domains/accounts can the compromised identity reach?
   - Pivot through dual-homed hosts to reach isolated network segments

6. DATA EXFILTRATION SIMULATION
   - Identify the most sensitive data accessible: domain admin credentials, database contents, PII, source code, financial records
   - Demonstrate theoretical exfiltration path (do NOT exfiltrate real data): document size, format, and exfil channel
   - Test DLP controls: can data leave the network via DNS tunneling, HTTPS to external IP, ICMP covert channel?

7. BUSINESS IMPACT QUANTIFICATION
   - Translate findings to business language: "Full domain compromise — attacker controls all Windows systems and all credentials"
   - Estimate regulatory exposure: GDPR Article 83, PCI DSS scope, NIS2 incident reporting obligations
   - Assign Overall Risk Rating based on achieved access level and data exposed

In-scope assets (IP ranges, domains, systems), testing dates, methodology: PTES + NIST SP 800-115, tools used (nmap, crackmapexec, impacket, Metasploit, Responder, BloodHound).

# ATTACK NARRATIVE
Step-by-step walkthrough of the highest-impact attack chain from initial recon to maximum access:
- Initial foothold: how access was first obtained
- Privilege escalation path: each step from low-priv to highest achieved
- Lateral movement: which systems were reached from the foothold
- Crown jewel access: what was ultimately accessible

# FINDINGS
For each finding (ordered Critical → High → Medium → Low → Info):
- **ID**: F-001, F-002…
- **Title**: concise vulnerability name
- **Severity**: Critical / High / Medium / Low / Info
- **CVSS v3.1**: score + vector string
- **CVE / CWE**: if applicable
- **Affected asset**: IP:port, hostname, service
- **Description**: what the vulnerability is and why it exists
- **Evidence**: exact nmap output, command used, screenshot reference, or Metasploit module output
- **Business impact**: what an attacker gains from exploiting this
- **Remediation**: specific actionable fix (patch version, config change, hardening step)
- **Effort**: Low / Medium / High

# ATTACK CHAINS
Multi-step paths that chain individual findings into complete compromise scenarios.

# REMEDIATION ROADMAP
| Finding ID | Severity | Remediation | Owner | Deadline |

Prioritize: (1) patch critical CVEs with public exploits, (2) disable NTLM / enforce SMB signing, (3) fix credential hygiene, (4) network segmentation gaps.

# APPENDIX
Raw tool output references, nmap XML files, BloodHound path screenshots, hash cracking statistics.

Write in clear professional English. The report must be ready for client delivery without further editing.`,
